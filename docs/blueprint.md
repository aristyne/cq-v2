# **App Name**: Code Odyssey

## Core Features:

- Interactive Roadmap: Progressive levels designed to gradually introduce and reinforce Python coding concepts for HKDSE ICT students.
- Code Console: An embedded code console at the bottom of the screen where students can write and execute Python code.
- In-Game Coding Challenges: Coding challenges integrated into the RPG storyline that require students to apply their Python skills to solve problems and advance in the game.
- AI Coding Assistant: An AI assistant displayed on a sidebar that provides real-time guidance, hints, and debugging assistance using an AI tool. The tool decides when to show hints, provide debugging help, or suggest code improvements, based on student performance.
- Automated Code Assessment: Automated assessment of student-written code, providing instant feedback on correctness, efficiency, and style.
- RPG Game World: Create a visually engaging RPG world where coding challenges are embedded.
- Personalized Learning Paths: Adjust the difficulty and content of the coding challenges based on each student's progress and skill level.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#32CD32) to evoke a sense of growth, learning, and exploration within the digital world.
- Background color: Soft sage (#DEEAD7), a muted, desaturated hue that complements the primary green and sets a calming, focused tone for learning.
- Accent color: Sunset orange (#F08080), analogous to green, providing a contrasting highlight for important UI elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look with approachability, suitable for both headers and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for clear display of Python code within the console.
- Use icons that relate to coding concepts.
- Sidebar with the AI Assistant always on the left, with the coding console at the bottom, game displayed at the centre.
- Use animations to respond to the code compilation or execution.
