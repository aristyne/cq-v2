This is a gamified learning platform to help you master Python, built with Next.js in Firebase Studio.

To get started, launch the app and begin your first quest!

## Deployment on GitHub Pages

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

To launch or update your app, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Commit and Push:** Make sure all your latest changes are committed to your local Git repository.
2.  **Push to Main:** Push your changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
3.  **Check Actions:** A GitHub Actions workflow will start automatically. You can monitor its progress in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
4.  **View Your Site:** Once the workflow completes successfully, your app will be live! You can find the URL in your repository's "Settings" tab, under the "Pages" section.

You can also trigger a deployment manually from the "Actions" tab by selecting the "Deploy Next.js site to Pages" workflow and clicking "Run workflow".
